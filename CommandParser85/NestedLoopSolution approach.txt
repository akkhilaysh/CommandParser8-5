Nested loop solution


As I could not get to the NestedLoop part of the solution before Sunday Noon and did not want to upload anything later than the designated time, therefore, I have uploaded the part that I had completed by then.


I would approach the nested loop solution in the following way:


It would be similar to the SingleLoopSolution except that I would put the part where the loop statement is checked and processed as it's own function. 


This function, like the code in SingleLoopSolution, will spot a loop statement and append all the lines within the loop for number of times mentioned after the delimiter. 


The nested loop method would make a call to the loop method (mentioned above) when it encounters a loop statement. If it finds another loop statement in the loop commands, I will make a recursive function call to itself and print out the lines within that loop statement for the number of times mentioned after the delimiter.


The key difference between the SingleLoopSolution and the NestedLoopSolution is the recursive call made to the function that detects a loop statement and writes statements within the loop into the file.
